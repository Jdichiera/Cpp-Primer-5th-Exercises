One of the main differences between an int, long, long long, and short are that they can hold different ranges of numbers which I believe will be based on the users system. Another difference is that each type has a differnt minimum size.

Float and double are similar to the types listed above in that each will represent a range of numbers, but different in the fact that floats and doubles can represent numbers with a fractional precision.
