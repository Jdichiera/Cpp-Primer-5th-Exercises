For a mortgage payment I would use a double for my calculations. This is based on the texts advice about the cost of double calculations and the fact that I would want precise fractional calculations for a mortgage payment. I know that I would be dealing with some percentage and fractional dollar amounts so any non fractional types (int, long) would not be appropriate.
