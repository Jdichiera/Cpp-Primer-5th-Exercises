Lines 1 and 2 will compile with no issues since the opening and closing comment indicators are string literals

Line 3 will not compile since the opening comment indicator is not a string literal and will begin a comment block. The closing comment indicator falls inside of the open quote for the string literal. This will cause the opening quote to be commented out. To fix this error you could move the closing comment indicator from the end of the expression to before the opening quote.

```std::cout << /* */ "*/";```

Initially I believed that line 4 would not compile, but after attempting it I found that I was wrong. The opening comment indicator is not a string literal, but the first closing comment indicator is. This will cause the opening quote to be inside of a comment, but the closing quote to be outside of the comment. However the second opening comment indicator begins a new comment and when paired with the second opening comment indicator string literal creates a closing quote outside of the comment. The result is a comment, a string literal, and another comment. Even though it could be written more clearly this is a valid expression.


```std::cout << /* "*/" /* "/*" */;```
