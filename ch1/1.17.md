If all of the integers entered are equal then the first if statement inside of the while statement will be true. This will continually increment the counter and never reach the else statement inside of the while statement or the statement that prints the count outside of the while statement. This means that no counting results will ever be displayed to the user.

If all of the integers are different then the if statement inside of the while statement will never be entered. Only the else statement inside of the while statement will be evaluated. The user will see output but the counter will always be at 1.
