The program fragment is _not_ legal.

Each line is terminated but lines 2 and 3 are not full expressions since they begin with a stream operator  (<<) and not an ostream object operand (std::cout).

The fragment as it exists now would not compile and would return an error message.

To fix the fragment you could remove the expression terminators on lines 1 and 2, or you could begin lines 2 and 3 with std::cout operands.
